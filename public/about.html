<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Software Analysis and Development student, my focus is on applying technical knowledge to create effective and efficient solutions in real-world environments. My training has allowed me to develop solid skills in requirements analysis, system design, and application development, which I complement with experience across different sectors.

  Currently, in my role as Lab Services I at AbbVie, I manage and process biological samples with precision, strictly following standard operating procedures and quality standards. This experience has taught me to be meticulous in attention to detail and to work under high standards, skills that are transferable to the field of software development.</p>

<p>Previously, as a Biologic Operator at AbbVie, I contributed to the production of small-volume parenterals, operating various equipment and collaborating with my team to achieve production goals and troubleshoot operational issues.

  My dual background in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, combined with my specialization in Software Analysis and Development, allows me to approach challenges from both a technical and human-centered perspective. I am passionate about continuous improvement, data analysis, and developing applications that make a positive impact. I am constantly learning, seeking to refine my skills, and contribute innovative solutions to the tech field.</p>
